This repository will contain my solutions for the Python Morsels exercises (created by Python coach, Trey Hunner of Truthful Technologies).
These are *my own* solutions to the challenges, these can hopefully help me grow in my Python Skill and also spark discussion on different approaches and methods.

Trey makes it a point to send through solutions to the exercises to - he also hosts a weekly Python chat where some of these principles are also dicussed
